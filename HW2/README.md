# Homework Assignment

## Reflection

For this assignment, I created a simple web page that logs my favorite websites, games, and artists to the console. I also included a prompt for the user's favorite color. I used a separate JavaScript file linked at the end of my HTML document, and I set a primary background color using a style element in the head of the HTML document.

### Comparison with AI-generated Homework

I used Copilot to generate the assignment for me. The output from Copilot was straightforward and matched the requirements of the assignment. If I had only used the output from the generative AI model, I think I could still explain the code since the comments and structure made it clear. However, creating the code myself gave me a deeper understanding and reinforced my learning.

Overall, I still believe that a person still needs to understand the structure of html code to really understand it and be fluid with it.

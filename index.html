            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>For my skills I have an Associates in Information Technology, several yrs working at a print and graphic design
     		shop. I have done bindery, designed custom business cards, worked with different types of media on wide format
     		printers, signs, brochures etc.. My inspiration is to work at a design shop or open my own. Some of the organizations
     		that I have done design work for is FWP, and several schools around the state. I will graduate this spring with 
     		a bachelor of fine arts degree.</p>

            <h2>Memory of Playing a Game</h2>
            <p>The coolest game or at least I thought was sonic the hedgehog on Sega genesis and super Mario brothers on Nintendo.
 			I loved the graphics, motion, and design of both games. I have a PS 5 and I absolutely love it. Right now I'm playing
			Hogwarts Legacy and Sonic the Hedgehog and it puts me in my happy place and get lost in the games exploring.</p>
